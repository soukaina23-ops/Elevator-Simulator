# Elevator Simulation using Java.

Design a simulation for two elevators in a building and its occupants. 
There are multiple requirements that must be followed. In general, the building, the elevators, and the occupants must be able to update and register their own state after each movement, and this state must be displayed with each elevator arrival. There is also a component of randomization to change the state of the building occupants.
